✅ App runs without crashes
✅ All navigation flows work

### Phase 3 Success
✅ All tests passing
✅ No critical bugs
✅ Performance acceptable (< 2s launch)
✅ Accessibility compliant
✅ Ready for App Store submission

## 📝 EXECUTION NOTES

### For Each Agent
1. **Read task specification** from Feautes_Implementation.md
2. **Implement all subtasks** in the defined scope
3. **Create mocks** for dependencies not available
4. **Document integration needs** for Phase 2
5. **Test independently** with sample data
6. **Report completion** with deliverables checklist

### Mock Strategy Guidelines
- Add comments: `// AGENT X: Description`
- Use extensions for model additions when possible
- Create separate mock files when needed
- Document what real implementation should be
- Ensure code compiles with mocks in place

### Integration Strategy
- Integration Agent Alpha focuses on **data layer only**
- Integration Agent Beta handles **everything else**
- QA Agent validates **entire integrated system**
- Bugs found in Phase 3 are fixed immediately

### Communication
- Each agent updates this document with completion status
- Document all issues encountered
- List all integration requirements
- Provide clear handoff to integration agents
