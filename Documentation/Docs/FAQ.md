## Privacy & Security

### Where is my data stored?

All your data is stored securely on your iPhone or iPad using Apple's built-in encrypted database (SwiftData). Nothing is sent to our servers because we don't have any servers!

### Does Swiff send my data anywhere?

No. Zero data leaves your device (currently). Your subscription information, financial data, and personal details stay 100% private on your device.

### Can I encrypt my data?

Yes! When creating backups, you can optionally protect them with password encryption. Device storage is already encrypted by iOS.

### Will you ever sell my data?

Never. We don't collect your data, so there's literally nothing to sell. Your privacy is our highest priority.

### What data does Swiff collect for analytics?

None. We don't use any analytics services, tracking pixels, or telemetry. We have no idea how you use the app - and we like it that way.

### Can I lock the app with Face ID or Touch ID?

Coming in the next update! Biometric authentication and PIN lock are in development.

---

## Subscriptions

### How many subscriptions can I track?

Unlimited! Track 5 subscriptions or 500 - Swiff handles it all.

### Can Swiff automatically detect my subscriptions?

Not yet. You manually add each subscription. We're exploring automatic detection from email receipts and bank connections in future versions, but manual tracking ensures maximum privacy.

### What subscription types are supported?

All of them! Common categories include:
- Streaming (Netflix, Spotify, Disney+, etc.)
- Software (Adobe, Microsoft 365, Notion, etc.)
- Fitness (Gym memberships, fitness apps)
- News & Media (Newspapers, magazines)
- Gaming (Xbox Game Pass, PlayStation Plus)
- Cloud Storage (iCloud, Dropbox, Google Drive)
- Education (Coursera, MasterClass)
- And any custom category you create

### Can I track free trials?

Absolutely! Swiff has dedicated free trial tracking:
- Mark subscription as "Free Trial"
- Set trial end date
- Get alerts 3 days, 1 day, and on expiration day
- Automatic conversion to paid tracking

### What if my subscription price changes?

Just update the price in Swiff. It will:
- Automatically save the old price
- Create a price history record
- Show price change chart
- Alert you to price increases
- Track percentage changes

You can see full price history for any subscription.

### Can I track subscriptions billed annually?

Yes! Swiff supports all billing cycles:
- Weekly
- Bi-weekly
- Monthly
- Quarterly (every 3 months)
- Bi-annually (every 6 months)
- Annually (yearly)
- Custom intervals (e.g., every 45 days)

### How do shared subscriptions work?

1. Add a subscription normally
2. Tap "Share Subscription"
3. Select people to share with
4. Choose split method:
   - Equal split (e.g., $15 ÷ 3 people = $5 each)
   - Custom amounts (e.g., you pay $10, friend pays $5)
   - Percentage-based (e.g., 60% you, 40% them)
5. Swiff tracks who owes what automatically

### What's the difference between Pause and Cancel?

- **Pause**: Subscription is still active, but you stop tracking renewals temporarily. Use for subscriptions you've paused but might resume.
- **Cancel**: Subscription is cancelled, no more renewals or reminders. Use when you've actually cancelled the service.
- **Delete**: Completely removes subscription from Swiff. Can't be undone unless you have a backup.

Results are grouped by type for easy browsing.

## Analytics & Charts

### What analytics does Swiff provide?

- **Spending Trends**: Line chart showing spending over time
- **Category Breakdown**: Pie chart of spending by category

- **Monthly Comparison**: This month vs last month
- **Year-over-Year**: Compare to same month last year

### How accurate are spending forecasts?

Forecasts use linear regression on your historical data. Accuracy improves with more data:
- 1 month of data: Rough estimate
- 3 months: Moderate accuracy
- 6+ months: Quite accurate

Forecasts assume spending patterns continue. Life changes (new job, moving, etc.) affect accuracy.

Swiff analyzes your subscriptions and suggests ways to save:
- **Unused subscriptions**: Services you haven't used in 30+ days
- **Annual discounts**: Subscriptions that offer annual plans with savings
- **Price increases**: Services that recently increased prices
- **Cheaper alternatives**: Similar services that cost less (manual suggestions)

### Can I export analytics?

Not directly, but you can:
- Take screenshots of charts
- Export raw data (CSV/JSON) and create charts in Excel/Sheets
- Future: PDF report export coming

---

## Settings & Customization

### Can I change the app icon?

Yes! Settings > Appearance > App Icon

- Minimal (simple, clean)
- Classic (traditional finance look)
- Neon (bright, vibrant)
- Premium (gold theme)

### What currencies are supported?

Currently: USD, EUR, GBP, JPY, CAD, AUD, INR

More currencies coming in future updates. Note: Swiff doesn't perform currency conversion - it just changes the display symbol.

## Technical & Troubleshooting

### App keeps crashing. What do I do?

1. **Update to latest version** (App Store)
2. **Restart your device** (hold power button, slide to power off)
3. **Free up storage** (Settings > General > iPhone Storage)
4. **Last resort**: Delete and reinstall (create backup first!)

If issues persist, email support@swiffapp.com with device model and iOS version.

### Data isn't saving. Help!

Try these:

1. Force close Swiff and reopen
2. Check available storage (need 50MB+ free)
3. Restart device
4. If corrupted, restore from backup

### Import fails with error. Why?

Common causes:

1. **Wrong file format**: Must be .json for backups, .csv or .json for exports
2. **Corrupted file**: Try re-downloading or using different backup
3. **File permissions**: Ensure Swiff can access Files app
4. **Large file**: Files over 100MB may be slow to import

### App is slow/laggy. How to fix?

If you have 1000+ transactions:

1. Archive old data (export and delete transactions over 1 year old)
2. Clear cache (Settings > Data Management > Clear Cache - coming soon)
3. Close background apps
4. Restart device

Swiff is optimized for thousands of transactions, but very large datasets may slow older devices.

### Can I use Swiff on iPad?

Yes! Swiff is fully optimized for iPad with larger layouts and iPad-specific features.

### Does Swiff work offline?

Yes! Everything works offline since all data is on-device. You only need internet for:
- Downloading the app
- Future: Cloud sync (when available)

---

## Future Features

### Is cloud sync coming?

Yes! Cloud sync across devices is our #1 requested feature. Coming in version 2.0:
- Sync across iPhone, iPad, Mac
- Real-time updates
- Conflict resolution
- Optional (privacy-first users can keep local-only)

### Will there be bank connection?

We're considering it carefully. Bank connections would:
- Auto-detect subscriptions from transactions
- Import transactions automatically
- Show real balances

But it compromises privacy. We're exploring privacy-preserving options.

### Apple Watch app?

Yes! Coming in version 1.5:
- See upcoming renewals on wrist
- Quick add transaction
- View monthly spending
- Complications for watch faces

### Widgets?

Coming very soon! Version 1.2 will include:
- Upcoming renewals widget
- Monthly spending widget
- Quick actions widget

### Family sharing?

Under consideration. Would allow:
- Multiple people editing shared subscriptions
- Family plan tracking
- Household budgets

Requires accounts and cloud sync (coming first).

### Siri integration?

Coming! Siri shortcuts for:
- "Hey Siri, how much do I spend on subscriptions?"
- "Hey Siri, when is my next payment?"
- "Hey Siri, add a transaction"

## About

### Who makes Swiff?

Swiff is created by a small, privacy-focused development team who believe financial apps should be private, beautiful, and accessible to everyone.

### Why build Swiff?

We were frustrated with existing subscription trackers that:
- Required accounts and logins
- Showed ads
- Sold user data
- Had ugly, cluttered interfaces
- Cost $10+/month

So we built Swiff: beautiful, private, and free.

### What does "Swiff" mean?

"Swiff" = Swift + Efficient. We built Swiff to be fast, lightweight, and efficient at tracking subscriptions - just like the name!

### Is Swiff open source?

Not currently, but we're considering it for future versions to ensure transparency and community contributions.

### How do you make money if it's free?

Currently, we don't! Swiff is a labor of love. Future plans:
- Optional premium features (cloud sync, custom themes)
- Optional tip jar
- Business/enterprise version

Core subscription tracking will always be free.
