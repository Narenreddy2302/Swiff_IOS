   - Full device restart can help

4. **Restore from Backup**
   - If data is corrupted
   - Use latest backup to restore

### Import Fails

**Problem**: Can't import backup or CSV file.

**Solutions**:

1. **Check File Format**

   - Exports: Must be .csv or .json

#### Where is my data stored?

All your data is stored securely on your iPhone or iPad. Nothing is sent to servers. You have complete control and privacy.

#### Can I use Swiff on multiple devices?

Currently, Swiff is single-device only. Cloud sync across devices is coming in a future update.

### Subscription Features

Unlimited! Track as many as you need.

#### Can Swiff automatically detect subscriptions?

Not yet. You manually add subscriptions. We're exploring automatic detection from email receipts in future versions.

#### What if my subscription price changes?

Update the price in Swiff, and it will automatically track the change in the price history. You'll see a chart of all price changes over time.

#### Can I track annual subscriptions?

Yes! Set billing cycle to "Yearly" and Swiff tracks accordingly.

#### What about subscriptions billed quarterly or bi-annually?

Swiff supports:
- Weekly
- Bi-weekly
- Monthly
- Quarterly (every 3 months)
- Bi-annually (every 6 months)
- Annually (yearly)

### Reminders & Notifications

#### When do I get reminded?

You choose! Set reminders 1, 3, 7, 14, or 30 days before renewal. Or set custom dates.

#### Can I snooze a reminder?

Yes, in future updates. Currently, you can dismiss and it won't remind again for that billing cycle.

#### What if I miss a reminder?

Swiff sends one reminder per billing cycle at your chosen time. If missed, check the subscription detail view for next renewal date.

#### Can I change the reminder time?

Yes! Set quiet hours and preferred reminder time in Settings.

### Privacy & Security

Coming in next update! Biometric lock and PIN protection.

#### Do you sell my data?

Never. We don't collect your data, so there's nothing to sell. Your privacy is our priority.

#### What data does Swiff collect?

None. Zero. Nada. No analytics, no tracking, no telemetry. Completely private.

### Sharing & Collaboration

#### How do shared subscriptions work?

Add a subscription, then tap "Share" to split costs with others. Swiff tracks who owes what based on your split configuration.

#### Can others see my data?

No. Sharing is one-way. You track what people owe you, but they can't access your Swiff data unless you physically show them your device.

#### Future: Will there be real-time sharing?

We're considering a feature where multiple people can collaborate on shared subscriptions. Would require accounts and cloud sync.

### Backup & Data

We recommend monthly backups, or before any major app update.

#### Where should I save backups?

- iCloud Drive (automatic sync across devices)
- Files app (local on device)

- Any cloud service (Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive)

#### Can I restore on a different device?

Yes! Create backup on Device A, transfer the .json file to Device B, and import. Your data transfers completely.

#### What if I lose my backup file?

Unfortunately, if the backup is lost and you've deleted the app, data can't be recovered. Always keep multiple backup copies!

### Export & Import

#### What format is the export?

- **JSON**: Complete data with all fields
- **CSV**: Spreadsheet format (good for Excel, Google Sheets)

#### Can I import from other apps?

Coming soon! We're adding import templates for:
- Bobby
- Rocket Money (Truebill)
- SubscriptionsTracker
- Generic CSV format

#### Can I edit the CSV and reimport?

Yes, but be careful! Editing CSV files can break data structure. Always test with a copy first.
